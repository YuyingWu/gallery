You are on the demo page of the Fr√ºhling theme for the static site generator Hugo. Sources of the theme are available here: https://github.com/romka/fruhling. Sources of this demo-site are here: https://github.com/romka/fruhling-demo. 

The theme supports all standard Markdown formatting features:
- lists,
- **varied** _styling_,
- `code blocks`,
- photo galleries as a separate data type,
- and galleries embedded within other content.
<!--more-->

Using the shortcode `{{< embedded-gallery "path/to/gallery" >}}`, for example, `{{< embedded-gallery "2024/art" >}}`, you can insert a gallery located in the `content/embedded-gallery` directory. This is convenient if you need to reuse the same gallery in different locations.

<!-- {{< embedded-gallery "2024/art" >}} -->
